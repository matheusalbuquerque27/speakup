## 🔧 ESTRUTURAS LINGUÍSTICAS

### 1. Adjectives: Color + Noun

**Structure:** COLOR + NOUN

In English, adjectives (like colors) come BEFORE the noun.

a BLUE dress
GREEN pants
YELLOW shoes
```

**Examples:**
- I have a **red** shirt.
- She wears a **blue** dress.
- He has **black** shoes.
- I like **green** pants.

**Important Notes:**
- Adjectives DON'T change for plural:
  - ✓ red shirt → red shirt**s** (red stays same)
  - ✗ reds shirts (WRONG)
  
- Color adjectives don't change with gender:
  - a red shirt (masculine)
  - a red dress (feminine)
  - red shoes (plural)

**Multiple Adjectives:**
You can use more than one adjective:
- a **big red** shirt
- **new black** shoes
- a **beautiful blue** dress

**Practice Pattern:**
- "I see a ___ ___." (color + item)
- "I see a **red** **shirt**."
