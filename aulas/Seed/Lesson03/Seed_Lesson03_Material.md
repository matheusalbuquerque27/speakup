## 🔧 ESTRUTURAS LINGUÍSTICAS

### 1. Possessive Adjectives (Adjetivos Possessivos)

**Função:** Indicar posse ou relação de pertencimento

| Subject Pronoun | Possessive Adjective | Example |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| I | **my** | **My** father is tall. |
| You | **your** | **Your** sister is beautiful. |
| He | **his** | **His** brother is a doctor. |

| It | **its** | The dog and **its** owner. |
| We | **our** | **Our** family is big. |
| They | **their** | **Their** parents are nice. |

**Pontos Importantes:**
- Adjetivos possessivos NUNCA mudam de forma (singular/plural)
- Sempre vêm ANTES do substantivo
- NÃO usamos artigo (the, a, an) com possessivos

**Exemplos:**
- ✓ My brother is tall. (CORRETO)
- ✗ The my brother is tall. (ERRADO)
- ✓ Her parents are teachers. (CORRETO)
- ✗ Hers parents are teachers. (ERRADO)
