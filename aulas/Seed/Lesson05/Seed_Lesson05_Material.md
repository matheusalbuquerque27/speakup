### 3. Countable vs Uncountable Nouns (Basic Introduction)

**Countable Nouns** (Substantivos Contáveis)
- You can count them: 1 apple, 2 apples, 3 apples
- They have singular and plural forms
- Use A/AN before singular countable nouns

**Examples:**
- **an** apple → two apple**s**
- **a** banana → three banana**s**
- **an** egg → four egg**s**
- **an** orange → five orange**s**

**Uncountable Nouns** (Substantivos Incontáveis)
- You cannot count them individually
- They don't have plural forms
- DON'T use A/AN before them
- Use "some" or no article

**Examples:**
- water (NOT: a water, two waters ❌)
- rice (NOT: a rice, three rices ❌)
- bread (NOT: a bread ❌)
- milk (NOT: a milk ❌)
- coffee (NOT: a coffee ❌ in general; but "a coffee" = one cup ✓)
- juice (NOT: a juice ❌ in general; but "a juice" = one glass ✓)

**How to Express Quantity with Uncountable:**
- a glass of water
- a cup of coffee
- a bowl of rice
- a slice of bread
- a piece of cheese

**Common Patterns:**

| Countable | Uncountable |
|-----------|-------------|
| an apple | water |
| a banana | milk |
| an orange | rice |
| an egg | bread |
| a vegetable | cheese |
| a chicken (whole bird) | chicken (meat) |
| a fish (whole) | fish (meat) |

- **a** pizza
- **a** sandwich
- **a** cup

**Examples with AN:**

**Remember:**
