### 3. Strong Advice - Second Conditional

**Structure:** If I were you, I would + base verb

This structure is used to give personal advice by imagining yourself in the other person's situation.

**Examples:**
- "**If I were you, I would** accept that job offer. It's a great opportunity."
- "**If I were you, I wouldn't** worry so much. Everything will be fine."
- "**If I were in your position, I'd** talk to the manager about it."
- "**If I were in your shoes, I would** apologize and explain what happened."

**Note:** We use "were" (not "was") for all persons in the subjunctive mood, though "If I was you" is also common in informal speech.
